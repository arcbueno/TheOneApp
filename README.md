# Hi! Welcome to The One App repository

### This app was created for learning Kotlin
### I am using the "The One API" by @frankanka and consuming its data

To access the API, just click [here](https://the-one-api.herokuapp.com/)

Maybe i will upload it to Google Play

This app was made using activities and so on.
For an example of app made with the Android Jetpack libraries, get in my [JetpackStudies repo](https://github.com/arcbueno/JetpackStudies)
